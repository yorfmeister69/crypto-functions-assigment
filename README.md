# Cryptographic Operations Web Application

This web application provides a user-friendly interface to perform various cryptographic operations, including the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) calculator, Extended Euclidean Algorithm, Hill Cipher encryption/decryption, and RSA encryption/decryption.

## Features

- **GCD Calculator:** Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:** Compute the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity and the greatest common divisor.
- **Hill Cipher:** Encrypt and decrypt text using a Hill Cipher matrix.
- **RSA Algorithm:** Generate RSA keys, encrypt, and decrypt messages.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yorfmeister69/crypto-functions-assigment.git
